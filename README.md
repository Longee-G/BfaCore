## Introduction

BfaCore is a MMORPG Framework based on TrinityCore written  mostly in C++.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.


## Requirements

Software requirements are available in the TrinityCore [wiki](https://trinitycore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/tc/pages/2130068/Requirements) for
Windows, Linux and macOS.


## Install

Detailed installation guides are available in the TrinityCore [wiki](https://trinitycore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/tc/pages/2130077/Installation+Guide) for
Windows, Linux and macOS.

## Reporting issues

Issues can be reported via the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/DisturbedNoob/BfaCore/labels/Branch-master).

We are using the same rules as TrinityCore!

Please take the time to review existing issues before submitting your own to
prevent duplicates.

In addition, thoroughly read through the [issue tracker guide](https://community.trinitycore.org/topic/37-the-trinitycore-issuetracker-and-you/) to ensure
your report contains the required information. Incorrect or poorly formed
reports are wasteful and are subject to deletion.


## Submitting fixes

C++ fixes are submitted as pull requests via Github. For more information on how to
properly submit a pull request, read the [how-to: maintain a remote fork](https://community.trinitycore.org/topic/9002-howto-maintain-a-remote-fork-for-pull-requests-tortoisegit/).
For SQL only fixes, open a ticket; if a bug report exists for the bug, post on an existing ticket
